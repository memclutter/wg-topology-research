# WireGuard Topology Research

A little research on WireGuard topologies. For my learning and for fun.

## Useful links

- [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/)
- [Primary WireGuard Topologies](https://www.procustodibus.com/blog/2020/10/wireguard-topologies/)
- [Ansible QuickStart](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/index.html#getting-started)
- [An in-depth guide to iptables](https://www.booleanworld.com/depth-guide-iptables-linux-firewall/)

## Structure

Each topology folder contains a README.md file, an ansible inventory file, and a playbook. 

The README.md file contains a link to the source where this topology is described, what requirements and how many resources are needed and instructions on how to deploy all this through ansible.
